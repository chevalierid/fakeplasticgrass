karimiliya-01.jpg
Inspired by the true story of ‚ÄúBlue 52‚Äù

Lonely Whale stands for community and caring, with the ocean and you at the heart of everything we do. Our journey begins with the story of the world's loneliest whale, Blue 52, and an incredible community of creatives, innovators, and big-picture thinkers. 


The one thing we all have in common? Our love for the ocean.
Our Guiding Principles

Address the system not the symptom.  While our campaigns seem fun-loving and light-hearted they are all data-driven and grounded in a multi-year strategy designed to support lasting individual behavior change and effect permanent changes to the system that continue to promote more single-use plastics.

Swing for the fence, every time. We have a sluggers mentality and it shows. We are constantly challenging ourselves and our partners to push the edge of what we think is possible.

Show up - relentlessly. We will innovate tirelessly until the ocean from which we draw so much - replenishment, oxygen and everything else we have yet to understand - is protected and flourishing. 
Meet the Team

Actor-Activist Adrian Grenier and producer Lucy Sumner founded Lonely Whale in 2015 with the intent of bringing the world‚Äôs ocean closer to everyone. Dr. Dune Ives, CEO, was brought on board in January of 2016.

Our team is intentionally small as we believe little fish can make big waves. üåä To expand our reach and capabilities, we partner with creatives, scientists, brands, influencers, and organizations that share our growth mindset to launch campaigns that have echoed around the world. 

Together, we‚Äôve #Stop[ped]Sucking in 25 languages and with hundreds of millions of people towards a collective impact of 15 billion single-use plastic straws permanently removed by 2021. We‚Äôve inspired industry shifts from single-use plastics water bottles to more sustainable alternatives and brought a new brand of canned water to market, empowered thousands of youth to create change in their  communities around the world, and we‚Äôre working with industry competitors and leaders to permanently keep 25,000 tonnes of ocean-bound plastic IN the economy and OUT of the ocean. We could not have accomplished any of it without YOU.
